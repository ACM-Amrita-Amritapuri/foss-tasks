# Tasks for application to the FOSS SIG

### 1. Setup your Github Account if you haven’t already.

### 2. Setup Git for whichever OS you are on

### 3. Get used to using Git and GitHub from your terminal and from the online GUI
- Learn about forking, branches and pull requests (from the terminal and from the GUI)
- Get your pull shark badge (Get two pull requests merged)
- Try to get a 2 week streak on GitHub contributions by setting up a fork of this repo and creating a guide on how you learnt to do the above.

### 4. Go through GitHub’s ‘good-first-issue’ catalog or GSoC’s organization list.
- This is to find some open source projects that feel like a good fit for you and your skills.
- It would help if you regularly use the projects you want to contribute to.
- Check each project’s techstack and see if you are familiar with it or if you can quickly familiarize yourself with it.

### (Seasonal Task: Register for Hacktoberfest and get 4 PRs accepted. Check out https://github.com/StuntStorm/Program-Collection if stuck)
